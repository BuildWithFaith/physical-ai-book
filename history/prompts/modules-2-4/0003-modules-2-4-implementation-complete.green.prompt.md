# Prompt Text
```
--title "Modules-2-4-Implementation-Complete" --stage green --feature modules-2-4
```

# Response Text
Successfully completed implementation of Modules 2-4 for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, including all content files, proper sidebar configuration, and successful Docusaurus build.

# Outcome Impact
All Modules 2-4 content has been implemented with proper directory structure, category files, chapter files with correct frontmatter, and validated Docusaurus site build.

# Tests Summary
Docusaurus build test completed successfully

# Files Summary
- /Users/mac/Desktop/ai_book/specs/modules-2-4/tasks.md
- /Users/mac/Desktop/ai_book/physical-ai-book/sidebars.ts

# Next Prompts
Consider creating a pull request to merge these changes or deploying the updated documentation site.

# Reflection Note
The implementation required fixing sidebar references to match the actual document IDs in the frontmatter, which was a critical step for successful Docusaurus build.

# Evaluation Notes
Failure modes observed: Sidebar reference mismatch caused initial build failure; resolved by correcting references to match document IDs
Next experiment to improve prompt quality: N/A
