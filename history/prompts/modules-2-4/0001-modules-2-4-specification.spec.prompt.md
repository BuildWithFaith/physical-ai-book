# Prompt Text
```
--title "Modules-2-4-Specification" --stage spec --feature modules-2-4
```

# Response Text
Created comprehensive specification for Modules 2-4 covering Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

# Outcome Impact
Successfully created a detailed spec.md file that covers Modules 2-4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, focusing on simulation, intelligence, and action. The specification includes learning outcomes, content requirements, and constraints for each module while maintaining conceptual and architectural focus.

# Tests Summary
none

# Files Summary
- /Users/mac/Desktop/ai_book/specs/modules-2-4/spec.md

# Next Prompts
Consider creating plan.md and tasks.md files based on this specification to continue the Spec-Driven Development process.

# Reflection Note
The specification successfully maintains forward references only without backward dependencies, focusing on conceptual understanding rather than implementation tutorials as required.

# Evaluation Notes
Failure modes observed: None
Next experiment to improve prompt quality: N/A
