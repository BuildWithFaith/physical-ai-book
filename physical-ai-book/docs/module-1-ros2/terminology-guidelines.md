# Terminology Guidelines for ROS 2 Module

## Consistent Terms to Use

- **ROS 2**: Always refer to as "ROS 2" (not "ROS2")
- **Robot Operating System 2**: Full name on first mention, then "ROS 2" subsequently
- **Nodes**: Always lowercase "nodes" when referring to ROS 2 nodes
- **Topics**: Always lowercase "topics" when referring to ROS 2 topics
- **Services**: Always lowercase "services" when referring to ROS 2 services
- **rclpy**: Always in monospace as `rclpy` when referring to the Python client library
- **URDF**: Always as "URDF" (Unified Robot Description Format) on first mention, then "URDF" subsequently
- **Humanoid robot**: Use instead of "humanoid" alone when referring to robots
- **AI agent**: Use instead of "agent" alone when referring to AI systems
- **Physical robot**: Use instead of "robot" alone when emphasizing physical embodiment

## Terms to Avoid

- "ROS" (when referring to ROS 2)
- "ROS1" or "ROS 1" (when referring to the original Robot Operating System)
- "Framework" when describing ROS 2 (use "middleware" or "robotic nervous system")
- "API" when referring to ROS 2 communication (use "topics", "services", or "actions")

## Style Guidelines

- Use "ROS 2" consistently, never "ROS2"
- Use the metaphor of "nervous system" when explaining ROS 2's role
- Use "distributed robot control" rather than "distributed robotics"
- Use "physical AI systems" rather than "embodied AI" in most contexts
